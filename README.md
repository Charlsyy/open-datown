open datown is an openstreetmap based application that allows the user to collect and use data about their home city. We want to empirically study the correlation between all kinds of different parts of a city. A special focus is set on election posters and if they correlate with environmental factors. By collaborating and improving the dataset we provide you can help making your city a better place
